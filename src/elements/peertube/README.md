# Peertube weblet

This weblet deploys a peertube instance with this flist
`https://hub.grid.tf/tf-official-apps/threefoldtech-peertube-v3.0.flist`

Currently, the weblet deploys all in one peertube vm on TF Grid v3, but it does not support the database persistance if the deployment is destroyed. But that will be supported in later versions.
